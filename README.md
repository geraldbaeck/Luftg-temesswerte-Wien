# Air quality Vienna

The city of Vienna only provides a half-hourly csv file of the current air quality but unfortunately no historical data. This repo provides an AWS Lambda function which queries this CSV and stores the original CSV and a JSON file whcih contains all valid data points to S3.

## Accessing the data

All data can be accessed here: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/luftguetemesswerte/

### Modifications and Reuse

If you do not like AWS and shit, just modify the script for needs. The source code runs with an [UNLICENSE.md](UNLICENSE.md). I would be happy if you drop me line and reuse the [UNLICENSE.md](UNLICENSE.md).
