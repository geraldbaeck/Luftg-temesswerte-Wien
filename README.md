# Air quality Vienna

The city of Vienna only provides [a half-hourly csv file](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/d9ae1245-158e-4d79-86a4-2d9b3defbedc) of the current air quality but unfortunately no historical data. This repo provides an AWS Lambda function which queries this CSV and stores the original CSV and a JSON file which contains all valid data points to S3.

## Accessing the data

All data can be accessed here: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/luftguetemesswerte/
